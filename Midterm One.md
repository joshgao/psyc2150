## Introduction to the subject matter
- This document is designed to be a thorough summary of the requisite material for Midterm 1 of PSYC 2150: Intro to Cognitive Psychology at the University of Virginia (UVa). Hopefully, all material from both the lectures and the readings are covered, but no guarantees or promises are being made. Do not view this document during the midterm, as doing so is a violation of the University's Honor Code.

### Overarching goals of the course
 - In recent history, the quick rate at which people and machines have improved in terms of problem-solving ability and information processing is astounding. Psychology is itself a "new" field, having developed later than the likes of physics, chemistry, or biology.
 - This course will attempt to flesh out the necessary concepts that allow us to decipher the *why's and how's* of things like Gary Kasparov's mind, ChatGPT, human memory & attention, among others.

- ### How to take notes in Lecture
    - Lectures are often conducted on a faster pace than a human can take proper notes, considering that the mentioned process is longer than what one may think. It includes:

        1. Listening to understand
        2. Deciding what's important enough to write down. 
        3. Deciding how to phrase that information
            + One often forgoes this in favor of verbatim dictation onto the paper.
        4. The physical process of writing/typing
        5. Deciding where to look.
        6. *Coordinating* these processes

    - So if it's so hard, why the hell do we take notes at all? *Answer: because it's a damn good memory cue.*
        - That's why dictation is so bad for memory: Because notes serve primarily as a memory cue and not a good way of learning, you have to write what you're thinking about at the time.
    - Notes are also a bad way of encapsulating *structure*: Lecture *content* is hierarchical, whereas lectures themselves are presented in a linear fashion.
- ### How to learn from complex reading
    Textbooks are often far more difficult to read for comprehension than other types of books like novels or biographies - this is because the latter often tries to paint a narrative, while the former doesn't care about comprehension, textbook authors simply need to get as much info down on the paper as possible. Here are a few tips on how to read better.

    #### Tip 1 - Don't just read and highlight
    - You may not understand the material as well as you think on the first read. You also might not be a subject matter expert yet. *That probably means that you don't know what's worth highlighting and what's not.*
        - This is supported by experiment - researchers bought used copies of textbooks and asked non-experts to highlight the important information; no one highlighted the same thing.
    - However, highlighting is OK if you already know a lot
    - In conclusion, charging in blind w/ a sharpie is not good enough. You need a plan

    #### Tip 2 - Use a reading strategy that fits your goal
    - Not enough to think "i'm going to read actively and connect ideas", need to set a concrete task.
    - Use the acronym **SQ3R**
        - **S**kim: Skim the article for headings, subheadings, and figures so you know what it's trying to tell you.
        - **Q**uestion: Pose questions you think the reading is going to answer
        - **R**ead: Read the text, actively searching for answers to your questions
        - **R**ecite: Recite what you learned as if explaining it to someone else. Summarize and determine whether or not your questions have been answered.
        - **R**eview: an ongoing process where you revisit questions and answers.

    - Additionally, place some blank post-it notes in the text, maybe one for each section

    #### Tip 3 - Take notes as you read
    - Notes help keep you on task and challenge you to be able to convert long-form textbook answers into digestible memory cues.
    - If the reading includes headings or subheadings, for each subheading, write a summary and make big-picture connections to rest of chapter
