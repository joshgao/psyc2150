## Introduction to the subject matter
- This document is designed to be a thorough summary of the requisite material for Midterm 1 of PSYC 2150: Intro to Cognitive Psychology at the University of Virginia (UVa). Hopefully, all material from both the lectures and the readings are covered, but no guarantees or promises are being made. Do not view this document during the midterm, as doing so is a violation of the University's Honor Code.

### Overarching goals of the course
 - In recent history, the quick rate at which people and machines have improved in terms of problem-solving ability and information processing is astounding. Psychology is itself a "new" field, having developed later than the likes of physics, chemistry, or biology.
 - This course will attempt to flesh out the necessary concepts that allow us to decipher the *why's and how's* of things like Gary Kasparov's mind, ChatGPT, human memory & attention, among others.

- ### How to take notes in Lecture
    - Lectures are often conducted on a faster pace than a human can take proper notes, considering that the mentioned process is longer than what one may think. It includes:

        1. Listening to understand
        2. Deciding what's important enough to write down. 
        3. Deciding how to phrase that information
            + One often forgoes this in favor of verbatim dictation onto the paper.
        4. The physical process of writing/typing
        5. Deciding where to look.
        6. *Coordinating* these processes

    - So if it's so hard, why the hell do we take notes at all? *Answer: because it's a damn good memory cue.*
        - That's why dictation is so bad for memory: Because notes serve primarily as a memory cue and not a good way of learning, you have to write what you're thinking about at the time.
    - Notes are also a bad way of encapsulating *structure*: Lecture *content* is hierarchical, whereas lectures themselves are presented in a linear fashion.
